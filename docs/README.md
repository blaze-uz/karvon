## Concepts at a glance

- **Workspace** — top-level grouping. You usually have one.
- **Project** — a folder on disk plus a set of processes and deploy scripts.
- **Process definition** — command + args + env + cwd + health check + restart policy.
- **Deploy script** — one step in an ordered pipeline. Has a `stage` (pre / main / post).
- **Machine** — local (default) or remote (SSH). Processes and deploy scripts can target any machine.
- **Auto-deploy** — poller compares the project's git working tree to its
  remote and runs the deploy pipeline when the remote moves ahead.

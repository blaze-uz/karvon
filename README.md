# Karvon

**The macOS panel for every dev process — local and remote.**

Stop juggling 12 terminal tabs. Manage your APIs, queues, schedulers, collectors,
and deploy pipelines from one window. Treat remote Macs as if they were local.

## Why Karvon?

Most non-trivial backends are *several* processes — a web server, a queue worker,
a scheduler, a few language-specific workers, and often a collector or two. In
development you end up with iTerm split-pane gymnastics or a brittle tmuxinator
config. In production you're SSHing into one server at a time, running deploy
scripts by hand, hoping you remembered them all.

Karvon gives you **one panel** that:

- Starts, stops, restarts every process by project
- Streams stdout/stderr with virtualized rendering — millions of log lines stay snappy
- Runs **TCP / HTTP / custom-command** health checks and auto-restarts failing processes
- Drives **multi-stage deploy pipelines** — same UI for local builds and remote SSH deploys
- Polls `git` and **auto-deploys** when the remote branch advances
- Treats remote Macs as first-class targets — register them, route projects to them, deploy without leaving the app

Built with **Tauri v2** (Rust + React), so it's a real macOS app — fast, native,
no Electron memory footprint.

## Screenshots

> 📸 _Screenshots are being re-captured for the public release. In the meantime,
> the project's information density is: a vertical sidebar with collapsible
> projects, a main pane that swaps between Dashboard / Project Detail / Logs /
> Settings, and a unified log viewer with filters._

## Install

### Download a pre-built release

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)
curl -L https://github.com/blaze-uz/karvon/releases/latest/download/Karvon_aarch64.dmg -o karvon.dmg
open karvon.dmg   # drag to /Applications
```

Or grab the `.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/blaze-uz/karvon/releases)
and drag it into `/Applications`. The bundled updater handles future versions.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaze-uz/karvon.git
cd karvon
npm install
npm run desktop:install
```

Requirements: macOS, Node LTS, Rust stable, Xcode Command Line Tools.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full setup.

## 60-second tour

1. **Add a project** — point it at a folder, give it a name, pick a color.
2. **Define processes** — command, args, env, working directory. Set a health check.
3. **Hit ⌘+R** — the project boots, processes spin up, health checks run.
4. **Watch the logs** — filter by project, process, or log level. Search across millions of lines.
5. **Add a deploy script** — `git pull && composer install && php artisan migrate`. Stage it as `main`. Run it.
6. **Add a remote machine** — SSH user + hostname. Route a process or a deploy script to it. The orchestrator runs your command there over SSH and streams the output back.

Everything is JSON-serializable, importable, and exportable.

## Use cases

- **Polyrepo dev environments** — a Laravel API, a Vite frontend, a Go collector, a Python AI worker, all running on `npm run dev` equivalents, all visible at once.
- **Distributed dev rigs** — one main Mac for the UI, a second Mac for AI workers, a third Mac running queue workers. Drive all three from one window.
- **Production deploys without a Jenkins** — ordered pipeline scripts per project, run over SSH, with cancellation and rollback hooks. Auto-deploy on git push.
- **Always-on background services** — register your queue worker as `autoStart: true`, give it a restart policy and a memory limit, and the orchestrator supervises it across reboots.

## HTTP API

The HTTP API is **disabled by default**. When enabled, it binds to `127.0.0.1`
and requires a Bearer token. Every endpoint that drives processes, deploys, or
config is gated. See [docs/http-api.md](docs/http-api.md) for the surface and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/dashboard
```

- [ ] Windows and Linux builds
- [ ] Built-in cron-style scheduler
- [ ] Encrypted secret storage (currently relies on macOS Keychain externally)
- [ ] Plugin/extension surface for custom health checks and deploy steps
- [ ] Web UI mode for headless servers

Suggestions welcome — open an [issue](https://github.com/blaze-uz/karvon/issues/new/choose).

## Security

Karvon runs arbitrary local and SSH commands by design. Treat the
HTTP API token like an SSH key. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat
model and disclosure process.
